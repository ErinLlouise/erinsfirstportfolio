        <H2>As if talking to a non-technical friend,
            <br>
            disscuss...

        <h3>A time you got blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
<p>
Where do I even begin... This week was definately a step up from previous sprints. 
I got completely blocked on an incredibly simple test during the kata exercises.
This test was asking to assign the value of an objects property to the value of another objects property.
I felt a bit stuck on this for a while, so I used the following problem solving techniques...
<br>
I had already previously written down a few notes on objects so I read over those 
<br>
I then went and had a look back at the FreeCodeCamp exercises on objects, and eventually realised
it was not as complicated as I thought...
<br>
<br>
object.property = object.property 
<br>
<br>
Problem solved! Needless to say, it was a nice "Ah-ha!" moment for me. I think in this instance, I should have used
the rubber ducky method, because I knew I had done this before but couldnt exactly remember how.
</p>

<h3>Solved a problem in an elegant way:</h3>
 
<p>
    I think I solved the zen-garden challenge in an ellegant way (for me anyway). 
    The instructions were very clear, concise and easy to follow so I knew exactly what was being asked and how to do it (with a little Googling).
    I felt quite good during this challenge, I was very focussed and stayed in that "just right" state of flow - not too hard and not too easy.

      <H2>
          Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process
      </H2>

      <h3>Pseudodcode:</h3>
<p>
    I used pseudocode for every test in the kata challenges. 
    Using this problem solving technique was really useful when approaching the task and breaking it down step by step.
    I used pseudocode particularly when being introduced to new nuilt-in functions like .split() etc

<h3>
    Rubber ducky method
</h3>

<p>
    When I particularly stuck on a problem, I did try to use this method and found that 
    when I only used it when I <em>really</em> didn't know what I was doing. So, I think
    this method will be incredibly useful for me in about three months time when I have a 
    better understanding of the language.

<h3>
    Reading error messages
</h3>

<p>
    The error messages in the kata challenges were very helpful and obviously pinpoint exact parts of your code 
    that are incorrect or need to change. This made the problem solving process much easier especially when youre
    not quite sure how to solve it, you now know the correct keywords to chucl into Google!

<h3>
    Console.logging
</h3>
<p>
I did not use this as a problem solving technique but will consider it in the future.

    Googling

<p>
    I had MDN and W3C tabs open at the ready for each and every challenge.

<h3>
    Asking your peers or facilitators for help
</h3>

<p>
I asked a few people for help and guidance when I felt really <em>really</em> stuck. 
This was really nice to get to know my fellow foundations peers a bit more, and also 
give them the opportunity to teach what they had learned. When asking my peers or 
my facilitator for help, they pointed out what needed changing and walked me through
how to solve the problem rather than just telling me what to write - this was really 
beneficial for me and helped me better understand how to solve similar problems like 
that in the future.

<h3>
Improving your process with reflection
</h3>

<p>
    I think daily reflection is very important when learning something as complex as this.
    I found that being able to identify what areas I was struggling with, came well thoughtout
    goals and actions. By doing this, I found a really helpful book, "You Don't Know JavaScript",
    which has been really helpful in slowly strengthening those areas.
