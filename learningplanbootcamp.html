        <H2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</H2>
    
            <p>
                Post EDA graduation I want to find a job with a company that I 
                love and work with a team of great people for a few years while
                I continue to develope my skills. I am also considering doing 
                freelance webdevelopment for small busniesses or individuals but 
                I am not too sure yet.

        <H2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</H2>

            <p>
                I think a strength I can bring to bootcamp is personal time management.
                Considering my realisations in my final reflection, I believe I can and 
                will manage my time wisely when working individually and in a team.
                <br>
                Two distinctive limitations come to mind. First being public speeking.
                In bootcamp, I believe we are required to do live coding presentations
                to our kohort which I the last thing I want to do - I absolutely hate 
                presenting myself or my work in front of more than a few people.
                <br>
                Other limitation is tiredness. I have chronic fatigue which can sometimes 
                impact my work when I don't give my brain rest - I will be trying my 
                very best to avoid this.

        <H2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</H2>

            <p>
                I do really enjoy talking and getting to know to people and generally 
                don't have much social shyness (unless its public speaking - obviously).
                But I suppose this will be the first time in my life where I spend lots 
                of time with people who are not my own age and are most likely more 
                mature and wiser than myself. I suppose one of my worries is that I may 
                struggle to connect with some people but with the human skills development,
                I don't think it will be a problem!

        <H2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like 
            to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</H2>

        <p>
            Definitely public speaking and presenting myself to a group
            of people.

        <H2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</H2>

        <p>
            From what I have experienced so far, EDA staff has been 
            more than accomodating and helpful when it comes to the 
            tech skills so I suppose I would expect the same kind of 
            helpfulness with human skills.

        <H2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</H2>

        <p>
            One thing that I really want to be able to accomplish is 
            practicing meditation. I find it helpful and relaxing when 
            I do it - which is about once a month. So I want to be able 
            to get into a habit and find the right kind of meditation that
            works well for me.
