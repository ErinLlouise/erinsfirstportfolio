        <H2>What is emotional intelligence?</H2>
<p>
    Emotional intelligence is "the ability to percieve, control and evaluate emotion in onself and othere and to use that information appropriately"
    <br>
   <em>- Normal E. Rosenthal, M.D</em>
   <br>
   <br>
   Psychologist, Daniel Goleman, describes EQ in his book, "Emotional Intelligence" (1995) as the ability to "handle ourself and relations".
   <br>
This is shown through four domains as follows:
<br>
- self awareness - knowing what we feel and why we feel it
<br>
- self management - handling our distressing emotions efficiently
<br>
- Empathy - knowing what someone else is feeling
<br>
- Relationship management - putting all domains together for better socials skills and inducing a desired responses from others
