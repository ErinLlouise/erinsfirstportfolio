        <H2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</H2>
<p>
    My long term goal (or dream) is to become a full time employed web developer for a company that I love. I want to work alongside great people and thrive in a team environment.
    The pathway to get there looks like this:
    <br>
    I want to graduate from Dev Academy while feel proud and confident of my (hopefully) high achievements.
    <br>
    After graduation I want to continue to develope my portfolio and make and create lots of websites to show my skills.
    I am very interested in a few interships that pop up annually from different NZ companies. One of these is a summer internship with CoGO based in Wellington. CoGo is an amazing app
    and I have kept my eye on the opportunities they offer and would love to gain experience working for them.

    <H2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning </H2>
<p>
    As mentioned in a previous blog post, my strengths and limitations in relation to my learning involve the following:
    <br>
    <br>
	Strengths:
    <br>
	Project management & time management skills
    <br>
	Communication skills & decision making
    <br>
	Creativity & generating creative ideas
    <br>
	Self awareness, self reflection, & honesty
    <br>
    <br>
	Limitations:
    <br>
	Patience - easily stressed/frustrated with myself (not others)
    <br>
	public speaking
    <br>
	Intelligence insecurity - being too critical of myself - dont think I am "smart enough"
    <br>
	I can be overly opinionated occasionally (stems from honesty strength but can sometimes be too much)

    <H2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</H2>
<p>
    I would really like to further develope my public speaking skills. I am terrible when it comes to presenting myself and my work to groups of people and fear I will never be confident in 
    doing it. During bootcamp I am going to make myself present to the group even if I have no clue what I am doing. I think this will help build confidence in myself when presenting work
    and I find I don't really know what I am talking about I atleast will; 
    <br>
    1) learn something new from others that I struggle to explain
    <br>
     2) build confidence in myself even if/when it goes horribly
    wrong and not in my favor.

    <H2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</H2>
        <br>
        <h3>
            <em>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
            </em>
        </h3>
<p>
    At EDA, I will manage myself and my workload by applying the following habits:
    <br>
	No zero days: I found what was mentioned in the course preperation to foundations was incredibly helpful which was ensuring practice every single day - no matter how big or small
    <br>
	Task responsibility and task balance: I have always strongly enforced task responsibility on myself especially when working with others. During this programme, the last thing I
	would want is to dissapoint anyone around me by not delivering what I promised. Achieving this would be by not only taking task responsibily, but being able to manage and balance
	my time when working with those tasks. I find implementing an agile project management/development system like scrum or kanban (depending on the project length/workload) works 	
	really well for me. I use backlog, to-do, doing, done, on my whiteboard to organise my tasks, and time myself using Toggl to ensure I am spending an appropropriate amount of time on
	each task. I really like the timeboxing strategy that EDA applies to sprint work, I find it really helpful when organising my time and tasks. 
</p>

<h3>
    <em>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?
    </em>
</h3>

<p>
    At EDA, when things are buidling up and start getting to me, I will apply the following habits
    <br>
    <br>
	Practicing the reccomended framework when approaching a difficult task. This includes:
    <br>
		Get intentional and habitual
        <br>
		Start your timer
        <br>
		Understand: Get clear on what is being asked
        <br>
		Plan: Plan your approach
        <br>
		Divide: Break into small steps
        <br>
		Make an attempt at solving it (write an initial solution)
        <br>
		Get unstuck
        <br>
		Improve your solution (Refactor)
        <br>
		Learn what you learned (Reflect)
        <br>
		Practice
        <br>
	I have found this framework works really well when I find a task difficult.
    <br>
    <br>
	Practicing patience and taking care of my head: 
    <br>
    As previously mentioned in my limitations, I tend to get easily impatient and frustrated if I find I am falling behind 
	schedule or am struggling to understand something. I have recently started taking short breaks every 35mins or so where I do a few push ups, sit ups, stretch my whole body 
	and walk around the house for a bit. I always feel 100% better, more relaxed and focussed when I do this and have found my workflow to be much more sufficient.

    <H2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</H2>
<p>
    I plan to seek help when I know I definatly can not solve a problem on my own. I would firstly apply the EDA framework as previously mentioned, then search on Google to see if
	a solution can be found there. If I still can not find a solution, I will plan to reach out to both the #foundations and #code-help-desk slack chats where hundreds of
	developers are connected to also. 
    <br>
    I also plan to reach out to my facilitator, Joseph, who is an incredily helpful and approachable person. I feel it is neccessary to reach out	to
	him whenever I feel struggle so he understands my strengths and limitations awell as progress and development.

    <H2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</H2>
<p>
    
	I am so far very happy and impressed with the facilitation team, and more specificly, my facilitator. I think out of everything I would want in a facilitator would be a kind,
	approachable human that genuinely cares about me and my progress, which is what I currently have so I am very grateful for that.
