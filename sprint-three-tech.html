        <H2>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS:</H2>
<p>
Imagine HTML as a plain, layered cake. It has structure, yet not much <em>flavour</em>. 
<br>
CSS would be the icing between the layers, the fondant, the edible flowers if you will. CSS is everything needed to give the cake style, flavour, and make it actually look like a cake.

    <H2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life:</H2>
<p>
    In computer programming, control flow or flow of control is "the order function calls, instructions, and statements are executed or evaluated when a program is running". 
    <br>
    <em>
        - Source: What is control flow? (2018, November 13). Retrieved February 18, 2021, from https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/contflow.htm
    </em>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The control flow runs line by line until a loop is introduced. The loop runs until a condition is met, then the control flow continues.
    <br>
    <br>
    An everyday analogy for this can be shown through poker night with your friends!
    <br>
    <br>
   - the game is set set
   <br>
   - everyone puts their chips in
   <br>
   - the cards are dealt
   <br>
   - the cards are placed on the table
   <br>
   - the first game begins (the loop begins)
   <br>
   - the game keeps going, player after player 
   <br>
   - the next card is revealed
   <br>
   - players drop out or put chips in
   <br>
   - the next card is revealed
   <br>
   - players drop out or put chips in
   <br>
   - the final card is revealed
   <br>
   - the winner is announced (a condition has been met)
   <br>
   - the winner collects their winnings 
   <br>
   - everybody cheers!

    <H2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it:</H2>
<p>
    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming API for HTML and XML documents.
    <br> 
    DOM is an object representation of your entire HTML document (web page & code editor).
    The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages (JavaScript) can connect to the page.
    These nodes can be elements, attributes, text content, comments and any other document related stuff.
    <br>
    You can interact with the dom by manipulating, adding or deleting HTML elememts on the document through the DOM console.

    <H2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects:</H2>
<p>
  An <strong>array</strong> is a type of variable that can hold and store multiple items. These items can consist of strings, numbers, booleans, objects etc.
  Items within these arrays are accessed by their numerical position in the list. You can access, add and remove items from an array by using zero-based indexing (first item in an array always has an index of 0).
<br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>Objects</strong> are variables that contain many values of any primitave data type, to represent a "thing" in JavaScript. This "thing" could be a person, a car, a book or anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of <em>characteristics</em>.
  In these objects, these characteristics are called <em>properties</em>. These properties contain a <em>key</em> and a <em>value</em>.
  <br>
  You can access, add, change and remove any properties within an object by using dot or bracket notation.

    <H2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful:</H2>
<p>
  A function is a section of code in Javascript, designed to perform a specific task. 
  The code inside a function contains arguments. Arguments are the values recieved by the function when it is called. Functions can be called throughout the script.
  <br>
  Functions are incredibly useful in JavaScript as you can define the code once, and then use the same code many times with different arguments to produce different results.
