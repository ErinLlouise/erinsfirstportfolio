           <H2>Communication skills & decision making</H2>
<p>
    I think I have always had good communication skills when working with other people. I have lead team projects in Uni because I could communicate well and make decisions. I enjoy working with other people and companies, as well as getting to know people in my personal life. 
   <br>
    I am good in job interviews and can communicate clear and concisely.

<h2>Self awareness, self reflection, & honesty</h2>
<p>
   As mentioned in my values, I believe a strength of mine in my profession life is self awareness including honesty and self reflection.
   <br>
   This ties into my communication skills where I can happily work with people and remain <em>"interested, not interesting".</em>

<h2>Project management & time management skills</h2>
<p> 
    In my final year of University, I completed a paper called <em>Creative Workflows.</em>
    <br> 
    This paper consisted of how to manage your time, money, task responsibility etc using a creative workflow model in a long term project.
    I genuinely gained an interest in this paper and still practice the methodologies and management skills when working on personal projects.

<H2>
    Creativity & generating creative ideas
</H2>
<p>
I have always enjoyed art particularly paiting using acrylics, digital art on my Ipad, creating and editing videos, and more recently, photography (which I am really bad at). 
All of these artistic skills I use in both my daily habits, hobbies and also my professional/educational life. 
<br>
I began the Creative Technologies degree because I knew I was a creative person and thrived in a creative environment - not because I was particularly tech savvy when I was 18... I loved coming up with creative project ideas that generally included a mixture of art and design and interactive technologies. 
This included my final project in Uni which was  a group project called Horotiu. Horotiu was a screen-based, interactive installation In Aotea Square that educated the public on the Maori mythology and history of Auckland CBD. This was done through hand-drawn animation (my project partner), lighting design and interactivity.

<h2> 
    <em>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths & limitations</em>
</h2>
<h3> 
    Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. 
    <br>
    Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
</h3>
<p>
    When I was in first year of Uni, I was absolutely desperate for money and decided to work 3-4 days a week while studying full time. 
    This did have an impact of my learning journey and grades and I definitely regret it. That's what Studylink is for!

<h2>
    Describe how your culture has influenced your values & identity
</h2>
<p>
    I think what is most notable about Kiwi culture, stemming from Maori culture, that has influenced my values and identity is kaitiakatanga (being one with the environment, and respecting the land) and manaakitanga (being hospitable). 
    <br>
    Kaitiakatanga has influenced me to value respectfulness of myself and others, and further having gratitude, empathy and mindfulness for the people around me; collegues, friends, family.
    <br>
    Manaakitanga has influenced me to value the people around me as individuals and treat them as my whanau. This also ties into self aware in my actions of treating people; being welcoming, “interested, not interesting”.

<H2>
    Evaluate your strengths & limitations in terms of your learning and career development
</H2>
<p>
    In a learning or career environment, my communication skills and decision making skills has helped me become the young, ambitious person that I am today. 
    I strived for a degree with high grades that I absolutely loved, I worked alongside individuals, other businesses and industry standard mentors to further my learning and career development.
    I am grateful to have an ambition to connect with the people around me - everyone has something to offer, everyone has a talent. 
    <br>
    What I noticed in studying Creative Technologies is when working in groups there always needs to be a chief decision maker. This was something we practiced in the first year or so.
    When it is hard to come up with project ideas or move into the next phase of a project there can be several difficult decision on where to navigate the project i.e do we include this feature? is it useful
    I found it was a good skill to quickly analyze the situation and make a decision to continue the flow of project. 
    Our lecturers would always say, “just make a decision on something and START IT, whatever it is, and then make more decisions and KEEP GOING”

<h2>
    Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey & how they might intersect with learning obstacles
</h2>
<p>
    One of my strengths, being a good decision maker, I think will help me in my learning journey. But I am not necessarily a good problem solver (that I have noticed) which is what a developer is when programming.
    I am hoping to grow my problem solving skills throughout this course with all of the individual and group projects.

<h2>
    Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension
</h2>
<h3> Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, & your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why</h3>
<p>
    I remember in a group project in uni where we were creating a hypothetical application called Ecocery. Ecocery was a phone app to help users purchase environmentally food products when grocery shopping. 
    You would scan the barcode, and information on the products ingredients, packaging, water footprint and carbon footprint, and how environmentally the brands company is as a whole, would pop up on the screen and give it an overall rating.
    <br>
    I decided to create the hypothetical app using Wix, which contained a section dedicated to informative article on how food impacts the environment. One team member wrote an article about transport for the website which I felt was not relevant and shouldn't be on the website as it is about food. 
    This did create tension between the team member and myself but we came to a rational decision to re-write an article together that was more relevant. We got an A for the project!
