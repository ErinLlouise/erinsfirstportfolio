        <H2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</H2>
<p>
    Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to adapt to changes in an individual's environment by forming new neural connections over time. 
	The brain changes continuouly throughout life in response to everything we do, and every experience we have. 
	By understanding these principals, the benefits that neuroplasticity has on people include:
<br>
<br>
	Recovery from brain events like strokes
    <br>
	Recovery from traumatic brain injuries
    <br>
	Ability to rewire functions in the brain (e.g., if an area that controls one sense is damaged, other areas may be able to pick up the slack)
    <br>
	Losing function in one area may enhance functions in other areas (e.g., if one sense is lost, the others may become heightened)
    <br>
	Enhanced memory abilities
    <br>
	Wide range of enhanced cognitive abilities
    <br>
	More effective learning.

 <H2>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</H2>
 <p>
    I believe I can easily identify areas where I am not particularly strong in - at the moment, it is understanding and remembering basic JavaScript.
By understanding the fact that intelligence (essentially) is malleable through practice and retrieving memory, is encouraging me to continue to practice JavaScript every single day.
 <br>
 <br>
 I am currently reflecting on what I understand so far, and continually practicing coding every day - by recalling these tasks and retrieving these memories, 
 their neural networks - groups of neurons that fire together, creating electrochemical pathways -- shape themselves according to that activity or memory.

  <H2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</H2>
 <p>
     <strong>You can increase your neuroplasticity by doing the following:</strong>
<br>
<br>
    <strong>Getting quality sleep</strong> - by getting 7-9 hours of sleep per nigh, allows the brain to reset brain connections. By doing so, your memory and learning capabilities increase therefore	
	increasing neuroplasticity.
<br>
	<strong>Learning</strong>  - the brain benefits from learning the same way the body benefits from exersize. This can be from learning a new language, art style, instrument or any new skill
	as long as practice and memory are achieved while doing so.
<br>
	<strong>Reduce stress</strong> - stress is a silent killer for neuroplasticity. If you struggle to reduce the sources of stress in your life, you must learn to change and control how you respond to it.
	This can include practicing gratitude, empathy and mindfulness or any other form of meditation. 
<br>
	<strong>Reading</strong> - studies show that reading fictional novels created heightened neuro connectivity in the brain. This stems from the power of thought and imagination. Imaginatio and action are	
	integrated and engage the same neuro pathways. So by reading fictional novels and thus using your imagination, this strengthens and increases your neuroplasticity.

  <H2>Discuss what growth mindset is and why it is relevant</H2>
  <p>
    People who adopt a growth mindset believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard-work. It is being able to use and understand the power of "yet".
	Having a growth mindset changes peoples views on accomplishing new tasks/skills as deep resilience and love of learning is gradually developed, utilised and essential.

   <H2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</H2>
  <p>
    Over the past week when first being introduced to JavaScript, I think I began to fixate on the fact that what I was doing was far too difficult for me to understand, and therefore
	I could not improve. After expressing these feelings with my facilitator, I felt much more sure of myself in understanding that I am on a steep learning curve and by adopting	
	a growth mindest and putting these thoughts into actions, I can most definately accomplish the basic understanding of JavaScript.

   <H2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</H2>
   <p>
    I think daily reflections are absolutely essential when learning something as complex as programming. Just as Dr Jordan Peterson suggests in his book, '12 Rules for Life, an Anecdote to Chaos',
	being rule number 4;<em> "Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today".</em>
    <br>
    By not comparing my sprint challenges or blog to others in foundations, and only 	
	recognising my own improvements and growth through reflection is how I can and will integrate a growth mindset in my learning journey.

    <H2>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy</H2>
    <p>
        Neuroplasticity and growth mindest have influenced my learning plan/strategy greatly when reaching out for help and also helping others. Over the past weeks I have found mysefl getting more involved with	
        the Slack foundations channel and responding to others with queries. I think a big turn for this was the listening and looping exercise where we got to express some of our struggles and have someone else	
        actively listen to us for two minutes. This exercise had similar effect to journaling, where everything you are thinking spills out on a page and you already feel 10x better. Then receiving that back and	
        really listening to what people have to say and repeating that back to them gave a sense of empathy and mindfulness an understanding that everyone has their own struggles and there is no harm in asking 	
        for help when it is needed.
