        <H2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself 
            and your ego as a result of the core learning?</H2>
        <p>
            - Over foundations, I have found I have 'pubicly' portrayed 
            myself as somewhat incapeable. Reason being I do not want to 
            set an expectation to others and then fail to meet those promises.
            I think this mindset is a fixed mindset and it is holding me back 
            from improving and progressing. It was not until the beginning 
            of sprint five that I realised this and felt I needed to make 
            some changes.
          <br>
          <br>
            - Similar to the previously discussed, I have realised a deep 
            rooted insecurity that I have had my whole life; intelligence
            insecurity. I have never felt academically strong and it was 
            not until I started researching into growth mindset and 
            nueroplasticity during sprint four that I started to think of
            myself differently. I think it took a while to understand that
            I am allowed to have this dream of becoming a web developer and
            I am allowed and perfectly able to progress overtime - so that 
            is what I am doing.
          <br>
          <br>
            - Lastly, I would like to mention some changes I made as a result 
            of these realisations. Last night I sat down with some paper and pen 
            and began discussing my feelings in regards to my progress over the 
            last four and a half weeks. In retrospect, I am really proud of 
            myself and I think I have done reasonably okay for someone with 0 
            JavaScript knowledge. But I do think I praised myself too easily, I 
            could have put in more effort, therby increasing my motivation. This 
            first point of somewhat unneccessary self expression may I think had 
            triggered the habits that follow, especially during lockdown.
            It is not that I particularly lacked motivation to do my required work,
            I loved doing it. I think I sometimes lacked motivation to attempt to 
            stop labelling myself as how I portrayed my intelligence to my peers.
            It is now that I finally understand what it means to have a growth mindset.
            I have been dwelling with this fixed mindset for pretty much my whole
            education without even realising it. Hence the following changes;
            <br>
            <br>
            - A sleep-in is not a reward
            <br>
            - Plan my day better through self-awareness, "What can I do today to improve 
            my programming skills?" or, "What am I currently not very strong at?" Setting
            small goals for myself if I feel I am behind and following through with them.
            <br>
            - My self reflection could be better. This was a realisation I had when journalling
            last night. I think if I continued to do this a few times a week, I will notice a 
            difference in my motivation, workflow, and overall self-awareness (that I have 
            previously claimed to be good at - guess there is always room for 
            improvement).
            <br>
            - and some other personal changes that I won't mention.
            <br>
            <br>
            In conclusion to this perhaps unneccessary essay, I do feel I have been a bit
            all over the place during foundations and lockdown certainly did not help. 
            However, I am more excited than ever to continue on this learning journey with 
            my fellow (very talented) peers. A promise that I have recently made to myself 
            is to fully embrace the sometimes shitty and most-times wonderful learning curve
            by being fully honest with myself and my progress and projecting that honesty in how 
            I portray myself. In other words, I am not an idiot ALL of the time

    <H2>What are the role of values, empathy and self 
        awareness in learning and programming?</H2>

            <p>
            Crucial. Looking back on my first few weeks of foundations, these values 
            can seem somewhat obvious; how else can one sustainably progress and succeed
            without these values? It was not until recently (re: my above rant) that these
            words actually sunk in. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Ones values are subjective, and funnily enough empathy and self-awareness 
            have been mentioned a fair few times in these core blogs being some of my core values. 
            I do have empathy and I do have self-awareness and I always have. 
            What are their roles? Their roles are fully dependent on how I view and utilise 
            them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Erin five weeks ago would say that empathy is being able to put yourself in 
            someone else's shoes. Erin now would say that empathy is being able to put 
            yourself in someone elses shoes and being able to fully understand how you feel in your shoes,
            aka, self-awareness. It is all <em>feeling</em> and being able to 
            understand, evaluate and reflect on your feelings and understand and respect 
            other peoples feelings. By utilising these roles and understanding their purpose,
            encourages and supports ones learning journey at a sustainable and healthy accelaeration
            and velocity.

        <H2>What has surprised 
            you the most about the core learning?</H2>
            <p>
              I feel rich in the knowledge I have gained even though it is readily 
              available to every human and at anytime (TedTalk.com to be exact). Why 
              such strong feelings? I suppose it is the habits I have now developed
              and the subtle yet strong alteration of my mindset. In other words, I 
              made some changes and it worked really well. 
              <br>
              I am surprised how much I was lacking pre foundations and I continue 
              to wonder how I could have made these changes without foundations 
              participation.

                <H2>What were the most challenging 
                    aspects of the core learning?</H2>
            <p>
                I suppose the most challenging aspect of core learning was 
                coming to the realistation that my current behaviours and 
                habits were not reflective of my core values. 
                I think back to sprint one where we introduced ourselves in 
                the slack chat and explained our core values. I felt proud and 
                listened to and generally happy with what I had shared to a group
                of strangers. But upon reflection, I was not entirely living up 
                to that standard that I expressed. 
                <br>
                Hard conversations lead to positive outcomes.

                <H2>Why do you think we, a programming school, 
                    are spending so much time focusing on core 
                    learning in a web development bootcamp course?</H2>
            <p>
                Two distinctive reasons come to mind.
                A) This academy's purpose is to help people be an 
                employable web developer. A great requirement and value 
                to those employers is to hire people with human skills; those 
                who can work well alongside others, have good communications 
                skills and motivation.
                B) As previously mentioned, being able to reflect and analyse 
                and be honest with yourself and others enables you to maintain 
                a sustainable and healthy web development career.

            <div>
                <H2>Does the time you spent studying core learning 
                    here feel like a waste of time? Should you have 
                    just used that time to practising programming 
                    instead? Justify your answer.
                </H2>
            <p>
                No it does not. There is something very special and personal 
                when it comes to learning this kind of material. Again, when 
                looking back at sharing our core personal values to each other,
                each indivual had something very different to share. Everyone had a 
                story invloving particular aspects of their lives and it was a 
                beautiful thing to read and experience. What makes this core 
                learning justifiable is that it must have impacted everyone as 
                much as it has impacted myself, and that impact can lead to some 
                amazing things.
